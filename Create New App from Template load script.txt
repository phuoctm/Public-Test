/*
Version History: Always add one row when application owner changes or app is released to production. Version number is date of production deployment or
"dev-DATE" for when development started (can be replaced with production deployment date if no new row is created then).
The reason why we put it script variable is that scripts changes can be easily tracked in GitHub and variable can also be shown in UI for users who
do not have access to loading scrip. (Qlik variables can store megabytes of data so no need to worry about variable length either.)
